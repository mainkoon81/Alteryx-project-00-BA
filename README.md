>**Dealing with dirty and missing data as well as outliers** (deduping, string parsing and replacements, and imputation)

>**Manipulating rows and columns of data** (transposing, aggregation, cross tabulation)

>**Blending data through joins and unions** (fuzzy matching, spatial blending to help with spatial analysis)
