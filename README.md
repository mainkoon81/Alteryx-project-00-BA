##  Data Preparation? cleaning + blending
__Issue:__ Data Source and Type, cleaning, Formatting, Blending 

>**Understanding different data types** (between strings, integers, doubles, and bytes)
 - Data Sources: transactional(supermarket, etc), devices(TV,phone, etc), collected(weather, census, flight, etc) How to make them available to use? 
 - File Sources: software, database, web

 

>**Dealing with dirty and missing data as well as outliers** (deduping, string parsing and replacements, and imputation)

>**Manipulating rows and columns of data** (transposing, aggregation, cross tabulation)

>**Blending data through joins and unions** (fuzzy matching, spatial blending to help with spatial analysis)
